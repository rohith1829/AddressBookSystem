# Address Book System

A simple **Address Book Application** built in Java using Object-Oriented Concepts.  
The program allows you to manage contacts with details like first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, and email.  

The project demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles  
- Console-based interaction with users  
- Use of Collections to store multiple contacts  
- Git branching strategy for each Use Case (UC)  
- Code hygiene (naming conventions, indentation, version control best practices)

## Project Branches  

This repository follows a **Use Case (UC)** based branching strategy.  
Each branch represents a specific functionality added to the Address Book System.  

- **master** → Main branch containing the stable version of the project.  
- **uc1-create-contact** → Implementation of creating a new contact.  
- **uc2-add-new-contact** → Added support for adding multiple contacts to the system.  
- **uc3-edit-contact** → Implementation of editing an existing contact.  
- **uc4-delete-contact** → Implementation of deleting a contact.  
- **uc5-add-multiple-contacts** → Added feature to manage multiple contacts in one address book.  
- **uc6-multiple-address-books** → Refactored code to support multiple address books.  


## 📌 Features (Use Cases)

### **UC 1: Add New Contact**
- Ability to add a new contact to the Address Book.  
- Input taken from console (first name, last name, address, city, state, zip, phone number, email).  
- Object-Oriented design used to manage relationship between `AddressBook` and `ContactPerson`.  

---

### **UC 2: Edit Existing Contact**
- Ability to edit an existing contact using their name.  
- Console input prompts user to update details.  

---

### **UC 3: Delete a Contact**
- Ability to delete a person from Address Book using their name.  
- Console input to select and remove person.  

---

### **UC 4: Add Multiple Persons**
- Ability to add multiple contacts to Address Book one at a time.  
- Use of Java **Collections (ArrayList/HashMap)** to manage multiple contact entries.  

---

### **UC 5: Multiple Address Books**
- Ability to manage multiple Address Books.  
- Each Address Book has a unique name.  
- A **Dictionary (HashMap)** is maintained with Address Book name as key and `AddressBook` object as value.  
- Console menu allows user to create/select different Address Books.  

---

### **UC 6: Exit**
- Display **Thank You** message and exit the program.  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java (JDK 8+)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (or Eclipse / VS Code)
- **Concepts**:  
  - Object-Oriented Programming  
  - Collections Framework (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)  
  - Console I/O  
- **Version Control**: Git  

---

## 🚀 Git Workflow
- Each **Use Case (UC)** is implemented in a **separate branch**.  
- Branch is tested and then merged with `main`.  
- Git commit messages follow proper convention (e.g., `"UC1 - Added ability to create contact"`).  
- Version history is maintained for review.
